# node-strom

Personal attempt to recreate git-like version management in javascript. Currently everything is build around a virtual filesystem adapter for testing my history and branching logic but it should be possible to exchange it with a I/O filesystem soonish.

It supports creating of repositories, commits, branching, checkouts and an early attempt at merging.
